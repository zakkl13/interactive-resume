# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing the Memory Bank to establish a clear understanding of the project state before undertaking updates. The project has been dormant for about 3 years and requires modernization.

## Recent Changes
- **Resume Skins**: Implemented a "Skin" architecture for the Resume page.
    - Refactored `Resume` to `ClassicResume`.
    - Created `TimelineResume` skin.
    - Added a `SkinSwitcher` to toggle views.
- Added location field to resume data and component ("EST" with hover context "Richmond, VA").
- Verified and updated Memory Bank with correct tech stack versions (Next.js 16, React 19).

## Next Steps
1.  **Refine Skins**: Polish the Timeline view and potentially add more skins.
2.  **Content Refresh**: Continue updating resume data and personal info.
3.  **Visual Flair**: Propose and implement design improvements.

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation**: Using Markdown-based Memory Bank to track context across sessions.
- **Framework**: Sticking with Next.js but upgrading versions.
