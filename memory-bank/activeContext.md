# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing the Memory Bank to establish a clear understanding of the project state before undertaking updates. The project has been dormant for about 3 years and requires modernization.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank` directory and core context files.
- Analyzed `package.json` to determine current stack versions (Next.js 13.2.4).

## Next Steps
1.  Complete Memory Bank initialization (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2.  Switch to Act Mode (already there).
3.  **Update Dependencies**: Upgrade Next.js, React, and Tailwind to current stable versions.
4.  **Update Content**: Ask user for specific content updates or look for data files to edit.
5.  **Visual Flair**: Propose and implement design improvements.

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation**: Using Markdown-based Memory Bank to track context across sessions.
- **Framework**: Sticking with Next.js but upgrading versions.
