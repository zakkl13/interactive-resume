# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing the Memory Bank to establish a clear understanding of the project state before undertaking updates. The project has been dormant for about 3 years and requires modernization.

## Recent Changes
- Added location field to resume data and component ("EST" with hover context "Richmond, VA").
- Verified and updated Memory Bank with correct tech stack versions (Next.js 16, React 19).

## Next Steps
1.  **Content Refresh**: Continue updating resume data and personal info.
2.  **Visual Flair**: Propose and implement design improvements.

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation**: Using Markdown-based Memory Bank to track context across sessions.
- **Framework**: Sticking with Next.js but upgrading versions.
