# Project Brief

## Overview
Zakk's Interactive Resume is a web application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a dynamic, interactive alternative to a traditional static resume, showcasing professional experience, projects, and personal details.

## Core Goals
1.  **Modernize the Tech Stack**: The project is currently running on Next.js 13.2.4 (approx. 3 years old) and needs to be updated to the latest stable versions of Next.js, React, and other dependencies.
2.  **Update Content**: Refresh the resume data, projects, and personal information to reflect the most current status.
3.  **Enhance Visual Flair**: Improve the user interface and user experience with better design elements, animations, or layout adjustments.
4.  **Maintainability**: Ensure the codebase is clean, well-documented (via Memory Bank), and easy to update in the future.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory Bank initialized and active.
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest stable versions without breaking functionality.
- [ ] Content updated with provided details.
- [ ] Visual design improved according to user preferences.
- [ ] Site remains deployable to Vercel.
