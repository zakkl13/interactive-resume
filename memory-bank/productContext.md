# Product Context

## Purpose
This project exists to provide Zakk with a professional, engaging, and easily shareable online presence. It goes beyond a PDF resume by offering interactivity, direct links to social/professional profiles, and a more personal presentation of his background.

## The Problem
Static PDF resumes are necessary but limited. They lack personality, interactivity, and cannot be easily updated or accessed from anywhere without a file download. A web-based resume solves these issues.

## User Experience Goals
- **Accessibility**: Information should be easy to find and read.
- **Engagement**: The site should feel alive (animations, hover states) without being distracting.
- **Responsiveness**: Must look good on mobile and desktop.
- **Performance**: Fast load times, leveraging Next.js optimizations.
- **Professionalism**: The design must reflect a software engineer's attention to detail.

## Core Features
- **Homepage**: Introduction, photo gallery, "Quote of the Day", and quick links.
- **Resume Page**: Detailed professional history, skills, and education.
- **Interactive Elements**: Typing animations, hover effects, maybe light/dark mode (already present).
