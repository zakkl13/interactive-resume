## Welcome to Zakk's Interactive Resume

### Overview
This is a simple web-app built on Next.js and deployed to Vercel. 

#### Why Next.js?
- Next provides a simple framework to build a performant web app
- There are multiple serverless platforms that provide no-config out of the box hosting
- React (which powers Next) has critical mass as a web framework and is something I wanted to learn

#### Why Vercel?
- Vercel offers serverless hosting for next apps, no configuration required.
- Github integration  is included as well and Continuous Deployment (CD) such that every "git push" to the main branch will update the production site
